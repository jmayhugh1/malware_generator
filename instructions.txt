The best algorithm for printing "howdy world" would be a simple one:

1. Create a function or program to print the string "howdy world".
2. Call or execute the function or program to display the output.

Here is an example in Python:

```python
def print_howdy_world():
    print("howdy world")

print_howdy_world()
```

This algorithm defines a function `print_howdy_world` that prints the desired string and then calls the function to execute the printing process.
